# CODEFORCES
DIV2 PROBLEMS that I have solved 
File Formate: cfXQ.cpp,   here X = round number, Q = question number   
So if CF round 440, question A, then file will be cf440a.cpp 
All codes written in C++ for now 

Also for each category, you can simply google the problem name in order to get the problem statements.  

e.g. file name is complete_the_word.cpp, then type "complete the word codeforces" in google to get the problem 
statement.
